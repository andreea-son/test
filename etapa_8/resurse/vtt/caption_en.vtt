I've always loved flowers.
As an artist, I've devoted my life to painting them.

00:04.000 --> 00:08.000 line:95% align:center
Flowers are a recurring theme in my work.
And, for me, being an artist is a lifestyle.

00:08.000 --> 00:12.000 line:95% align:center
I live for painting them.
For highlighting their beauty.

00:12.000 --> 00:16.000 line:95% align:center
Even though flowers are ephemeral, their beauty can be captured.
Through a picture, a painting, or even a memory.

00:16.000 --> 00:20.000 line:95% align:center
When it comes to memories, they are made from memorable moments.
Moments that withstand the passage of time.

00:20.000 --> 00:24.000 line:95% align:center
A flower that is offered as a gift can turn any moment into a memory.
A memory that will be cherished forever.
